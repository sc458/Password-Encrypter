# Password-Encrypter (PwE)

The Password-Encrypter (PwE) is a password manager written in Java which helps to keep track of all accounts and corresponding passwords you created in the past and will create in the future. This encryption algorithm we developed enables you to have access to all entries with a single master password. In other words, all the passwords you have can be stored securely and you can access all of them by remembering only one master password.

Here we describe in short the installation and usage. For a more detailed user guide and more insights into the encryption algorithm, we advise you to take a look at the pdf document.

The supported languages are English and German.

## Installation and Usage

To use the program you can either create a .jar-file from the source code or directly use the file PwE.jar that is already uploaded. The application must be opened with Oracle Java Runtime, leading to the start-screen of the user interface. 

From the start-screen, you can set up the master account or if already existing, log in with the master password. The language can be set to English or German, via Options -> Language. For help, you can select Options -> Help, which leads to the user manual. In this view, the basic abilities of the program are explained, in some similarities to the description here.
